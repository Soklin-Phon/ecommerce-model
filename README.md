# e-commerce Model

## Description

The e-commerce Model is a comprehensive and highly scalable web application that combines the power of modern technologies to provide a seamless and feature-rich experience for both users and developers. 
This project is designed to meet a variety of requirements, from building a robust RESTful API to creating a dynamic frontend interface with Angular 15, while hosting and deploying it on AWS Cloud for 
exceptional performance and scalability.

## Key Features:

- Spring Boot REST API: The backend is powered by Spring Boot, a versatile and robust framework for building RESTful APIs. It provides a strong foundation for managing endpoints, handling business logic,
- and integrating with various external services.

- Angular 15: The project's frontend is developed using Angular 15, a modern and feature-rich JavaScript framework that offers a rich user interface and interactive user experiences. Angular 15's components
-  and modules facilitate a clean and maintainable codebase.

- AWS Hosting: Leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS), the project is hosted in a high-performance cloud environment. This allows for easy scalability, redundancy, and reliable performance.

- PostgreSQL Database: Data is stored and managed in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring data integrity, security, and high availability.

- Single-Instance Architecture: The project employs a single-instance architecture, simplifying deployment and maintenance. It provides a solid foundation for small to medium-sized applications.

- Load Balancing: For applications with scalability requirements, AWS load balancing ensures even distribution of incoming traffic, increasing system resilience and responsiveness.

- REST API Architecture: The project adheres to a RESTful architecture, making it easy to interact with the API, perform CRUD operations, and integrate third-party services.

- Integration with Email, Shipping, and Payment APIs: The application seamlessly integrates with email services for communication, shipping services for order fulfillment, and payment APIs for secure and
- convenient transactions.

## Purpose:

The primary purpose of this project is to serve as a template and example for building robust, cloud-hosted web applications that require both a backend API and a frontend user interface. Whether you're 
looking to create a new e-commerce platform, social network, or any other web-based application, the e-commerce Model provides a solid foundation to jumpstart your development.
